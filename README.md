ChangingBackground - Coding Challenge
==================
## Inspiration
You will be asked to recreate the background changing effect that is found in Dryv.  Dryv is a Chicago startup that 
provides on demand dry cleaning.  Ora Interactive is building the [iOS App](http://orainteractive.com/dryv) which is 
currently in private beta.  

The application utilizes a subtle background color change throughout the application.  A demonstration of the effect can 
be seen below.  Notice how the background slowly changes from blue to green as the user progresses through the application.

## Challenge
Your challenge is to recreate the main color change functionality.  This repository contains a basic setup that transitions 
between two view controllers.  The background color image assets are also provided.  A demo of the solution is shown
below.
